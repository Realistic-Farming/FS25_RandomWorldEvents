-- =========================================================
-- FS25 Random World Events - Release Gate
-- =========================================================
-- The release gate: which systems are released (STABLE) vs experimental (LOCKED).
--
-- Orthogonal to difficulty. The gate is its own explicit opt-in (experimental
-- systems, on at your own risk), independent of difficulty, and the two locks
-- STACK.
--
-- Arissani's certification (2026-08-03, ledger): Random World Events carries an
-- EMPTY lock set today. The redesign is Tyson's keep-it-in call and unbuilt; only
-- bug fixes have shipped, and fixes flow free. Nothing is gated; the mechanism is
-- wired so a row can be added the moment a system needs locking. Releasing a
-- system for a stable release is a deliberate act, never a default.
-- =========================================================

ReleaseGate = ReleaseGate or {}

-- The certified experimental (LOCKED) set. Each entry: [systemId] = { name, status }.
-- `status` is a SHORT player-facing note on what is not working or implemented yet.
-- A system that is NOT in this table is released (the proven baseline).
ReleaseGate.EXPERIMENTAL = {}

-- Console command -> systemId, so command refusals route through the same registry.
